1. Hawaii's own true sons,
Be loyal to your king,
Your country's liege and lord
The chief.
  	 
2. Hawaii's own true sons,
Look to your chiefs,
The children after you,
The young.
  	 
3. Hawaii's own true sons,
People of loyal heart,
The only duty lies
List and abide.
  	 
Chorus:
Father above us all,
Kamehameha e,
Who guarded in the war,
With his spear.
